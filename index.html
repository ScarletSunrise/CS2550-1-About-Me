                <p class="haiku">
                    Climbing a mountain<br>
                    Witnessing the end of time<br>
                    Resting on a bench<br><br>

                <p>
                    Just a haiku vaugely inspired by some of my favorite games.

                <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
                <p>The strongest intrest I've held, ever since my dad won a GBA in a raffle when I was 4 years old, has been gaming. Honestly, it was really hard to choose between majoring in computer science or game development. Some of my favorites include Zelda, Metroid, Dark Souls, and many indies such as Celeste, Outer Wilds, and Factorio. </p>
                <p>Parallel to that, I also really enjoy computers! I wouln't be here if I didn't. It's just great to learn all the ins and outs of computing, both hardware and software. I yearn for the opportunity to build a new computer.</p>
                <p>Outside of tech, I'm also pretty into prog rock/prog metal. Yes and King Crimson are absolute classics. Lately I've been getting into King Gizzard and Tool.</p>
