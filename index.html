                <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
                <p>The strongest intrest I've held, ever since my dad won a GBA in a raffle when I was 4 years old, has been gaming. Honestly, it was really hard to choose between majoring in computer science or game development. Some of my favorites include Zelda, Metroid, Dark Souls, and many indies such as Celeste, Outer Wilds, and Factorio. </p>
                <p>Parallel to that, I also really enjoy computers! I wouln't be here if I didn't. It's just great to learn all the ins and outs of computing, both hardware and software. I yearn for the opportunity to build a new computer.</p>
                <p>Outside of tech, I'm also pretty into prog rock/prog metal. Yes and King Crimson are absolute classics. Lately I've been getting into King Gizzard and Tool.</p>

            <!--For the Class Schedule I want you to create a table that shows your weekly class schedule. This is easy to do using table elements, but it does require some attention to detail. 

            Make a level-2 header titled “class schedule”
            Create a table with 6 columns.
            Set the border size to 1, so I can see the borders for each cell. Set the cell spacing to 3, and set the cell padding to 3.
            The header row should have a blank cell, followed by cells for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. If you have a Saturday class (you poor soul), you can add a sixth column (or not, I don’t care, really).
            Going down the left side of the table, I want you to list out the hours of your week-day in 30-minute increments. You can start as early as you feel necessary.
            List the classes you have as cells. Use the row-span element to block out as many 30-minute cells as you need for each item.  If you have stuff that starts at an odd time, then guess.  I won’t care, as long as it doesn’t look all wonky.
            Fill up your schedule. Make stuff up if you have to.  I want to see at least four classes that run M-W-F or Tu-Th or every weekday.  In addition to classes, You can put your employment, your work-out time, your commute time, or anything else you like.
            Use the rowspan attribute, so if you have an hour-long class, the cell should take up two rows, without a line between them.-->
